		- Added note of compatibility issue between RQE and World Quest Tracker add-on in the TOC. A notation is currently listed on the RQE Curseforge page. This is something that doesn't exist if either RQE or WQT are used, but manifests in the form of some quests being listed as world quests when they shouldn't be. Problem goes away when WQT is disabled.

		- Added ability to clear Debug Log via slash command

	QuestingModule.lua
		- Reverted to QuestingModule from 2024-09-02.1726 as WQ were being hidden and made slight changes so some non-world quests wouldn't be counted but WQ would remain counted and listed

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Cleared out some of the code that was used in the creation of macros that was duplicative and potentially impacting add-on performance

		- Cleared unused debug msg
		- Fixed RQE.CheckCurrentMacroContents() function so it once again checks to see if existing macro is the expected macro

		- Added new setting to save Waypoint value (RQE.AddonSetStepIndex) to prevent RQEFrame from overriding when autoClickWaypoint is actively assisting player in quest step guidance (this would manifest by going to inappropriate waypoint buttons as quest progression occurred).

		- Added function to get the nearest super track questID
		- Added RQE:ClearSeparateFocusFrame function to clear the newly created master status frame within the RQEFrame

	DebugLog.lua
		- DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage() will now be displayed in the DebugLog

	EventManager.lua
		- Commented out most of the code within RQE.handleUnitQuestLogChange function as much of what is done here is already handled through the QUEST_WATCH_UPDATE event that gets fired before it
		- Optimized QUEST_WATCH_UPDATE event listener to improve efficiency of the add-on as increased lag was sometimes noticed when this event fired as a result of a quest being completed.
		- Settings added for when RQE.AddonSetStepIndex should be initialized and reset
		- Added better visibility to debug messages based on new setting added to 'Debug' section of the Config Frame.
		- Removed (commented out) many events that are redundant and were causing massive performance issues (particularly as player would progress through more and more quests)
		- Added code to set super track to nearest quest, if enableNearestSuperTrack is enabled (default: on) when QUEST_FINISHED event fires

	QuestingModule.lua
		- Added fix for WQ header being displayed when none are selected (some quests were returning with the C_QuestLog.GetNumWorldQuestWatches() API even though they weren't actually WQ as determined thru C_QuestLog.IsWorldQuest(questID)
		- Commented out defunct code

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Modified some quests in the neededAmt and objectiveIndex as some quests with multiple steps associated with a single objective need to start off a neededAmt of 0, some with a neededAmt of 1 (based on how the add-on is reading this step/its 'objective')
		- Improvements to the information from the pre-Isle of Dorn quests

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Switched some debug code to only print if INFO+ debug level is active
		- Created a master status frame that states which stepIndex you're on and what the stepIndex description reads (to avoid need to scroll with each stepIndex progression made)

	WaypointManager.lua
		- Added nil checks

	Misc.:
		- Cleaned up code (including spacing and indents).

		- Modifications to some quests to fix waypoints

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Modifications to some quests to fix waypoints

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Potential fix in place to keep RQE.LastClickedButtonRef and WaypointButton.stepIndex from resetting to "1" when in the middle of a quest (this is having the effect of setting the stepIndex/waypoint button to 1 and preventing advancement without a reload


11.0.2.32 (2024-08-31)
