11.0.2.36
	Core.lua
		- Adjusted timer before RQE.WaypointButtons[RQE.AddonSetStepIndex] button click fires

	EventManager.lua
		- Added auto supertrack nearest quest on PLAYER_ENTERING_WORLD (usually login/reload) if no quest is currently being supertracked
		- Added auto clear raid marker from target on quest turn in or gossip finished (as the macros will place target markers on NPCs)
		- Added initial click of waypoint button 1 when SUPER_TRACKING_CHANGED to generate the macro
		- Added click of the 'UnknownQuestWaypointButton' if no steps are listed in the RQEFrame ("supertrack frame" where info pulled in from the RQEDatabase, if available) or if autoClickWaypoint is unchecked, this fires on SUPER_TRACKING_CHANGED, ZONE_CHANGED_NEW_AREA, and ZONE_CHANGED_INDOORS


11.0.2.35
	Config.lua
		- Added additional options for debugging in Config Frame.
		- Added option that super track the nearest quest, if super track frame is empty when QUEST_FINISHED event fires (default: on). Placed this option in settings panel and configuration frame

	Core.lua
		- Updated debug prints with RQE.CheckThatQuestStep() -- this is a 'disconnected function' that is able to only be run using the in-game /run command in order to act as a debugging tool for quest progression
		- Added new setting to save Waypoint value (RQE.AddonSetStepIndex) to prevent RQEFrame from overriding when autoClickWaypoint is actively assisting player in quest step guidance (this would manifest by going to inappropriate waypoint buttons as quest progression occurred).
		- Added additional 'defaults' to set for the additional config options added to the Config Frame.
		- Added function to get the nearest super track questID

	DebugLog.lua
		- DEFAULT_CHAT_FRAME:AddMessage() will now be displayed in the DebugLog

	EventManager.lua
		- Commented out most of the code within RQE.handleUnitQuestLogChange function as much of what is done here is already handled through the QUEST_WATCH_UPDATE event that gets fired before it
		- Optimized QUEST_WATCH_UPDATE event listener to improve efficiency of the add-on as increased lag was sometimes noticed when this event fired as a result of a quest being completed.
		- Settings added for when RQE.AddonSetStepIndex should be initialized and reset
		- Added better visibility to debug messages based on new setting added to 'Debug' section of the Config Frame.
		- Removed (commented out) many events that are redundant and were causing massive performance issues (particularly as player would progress through more and more quests)
		- Added code to set super track to nearest quest, if enableNearestSuperTrack is enabled (default: on) when QUEST_FINISHED event fires

	QuestingModule.lua
		- Added fix for WQ header being displayed when none are selected (some quests were returning with the C_QuestLog.GetNumWorldQuestWatches() API even though they weren't actually WQ as determined thru C_QuestLog.IsWorldQuest(questID)

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Modified some quests in the neededAmt and objectiveIndex as some quests with multiple steps associated with a single objective need to start off a neededAmt of 0, some with a neededAmt of 1 (based on how the add-on is reading this step/its 'objective')

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Switched some debug code to only print if INFO+ debug level is active

	Misc:
		- Cleaned up code (including spacing and indents).


11.0.2.34
	Core.lua
		- Major improvements to the performance of the add-on
		- Corrected for nil error in RQE:CheckObjectiveProgress function
		- Many debugs added to solve issue with quest steps not advancing when the quest steps are listed in the RQEDatabase
		- Implemented new changes into the RQE:StartPeriodicChecks()
		- Cleaned up code and debug msgs to be swapped over the RQE.debugLog/RQE.infoLog instead of print

	EventManager.lua
		- Improved performance as associated with the SCENARIO_CRITERIA_UPDATE listener running too often and using a lot of resources (particularly loading screens when zoning out of story instances)
		- Added a display memUsageText with each event listener that fires to check if certain events are causing problems
		- Removed extra bits of RQE:StartPeriodicChecks() from some of the listeners that were slowing performance of the add-on by doing redundant/repeat checks of this hog of a function

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Many updates for quests (some quests need to have their first neededAmt of the first objectiveIndex set to 0 instead of 1, more changes may be further needed as debugging continues)
		- Modifications to some quests to fix waypoints

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Fix to performance problems and with quests not advancing properly from one stepIndex to the next


11.0.2.33-beta
	Core.lua
		- Implemented new changes from RQE.CheckThatQuestStep() into the RQE:StartPeriodicChecks()
		- Major improvements to the performance of the add-on

	EventManager.lua
		- Added a display memUsageText with each event listener that fires to check if certain events are causing problems
		- Removed extra bits of RQE:StartPeriodicChecks() from some of the listeners that were slowing performance of the add-on by doing redundant/repeat checks of this hog of a function

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Many updates for quests (some quests need to have their first neededAmt of the first objectiveIndex set to 0 instead of 1, more changes may be further needed as debugging continues)

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Commented out the added debug print msgs as they are no longer needed (or at least not at this time since seemingly fixing the quest advancement and performance problems)


11.0.2.33-alpha
	Core.lua
		- Corrected for nil error in RQE:CheckObjectiveProgress function
		- Many debugs added to solve issue with quest steps not advancing when the quest steps are listed in the RQEDatabase

	EventManager.lua
		- Improved performance as associated with the SCENARIO_CRITERIA_UPDATE listener running too often and using a lot of resources (particularly loading screens when zoning out of story instances)
		- Added several print debugs associated with 'RQE.LastClickedButtonRef.stepIndex being set to 1' (this is temporary)

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Modifications to some quests to fix waypoints

	RQEFrame.lua
		- Potential fix in place to keep RQE.LastClickedButtonRef and WaypointButton.stepIndex from resetting to "1" when in the middle of a quest (this is having the effect of setting the stepIndex/waypoint button to 1 and preventing advancement without a reload


11.0.2.32
	Buttons.lua
		- Removed unneeded code for preventing some code from running during combat - this appeared to be an error when this is actually taint and most of what I run should be fine to update their own frames in or out of combat

	Config.lua
		- Removed some debug print lines

	Core.lua
		- Removed unneeded code meant to prevent taint (handling different way for now)
		- Add ability to select specific gossip option based on macro in the RQEDatabase (when available)

		- Add additional bits to run function to update frame size when number of steps may exceed window size of the frame.
		- Removed unneeded code meant to prevent taint

	RQEMacro.lua
		- Code clean-up

	Taintless.XML
		- Added to file to reduce issues with such things like Button and Frame Pass-Thru errors that don't effect the overall functionality of the add-on, but are a nuisance unless you have BugSack/BugGrabber addons
		
	WPUtil.lua
		- Removed unneeded code meant to prevent taint

	QuestingModule.lua
		- Added Rewards Tooltip for the RQEFrame (SuperTrack quest frame) and the RQEQuestFrame (quest tracker)
		- Fix to propagate error with setting anchor points (RQE.RQEQuestFrameSetChildFramePoints() function) of child frames while in combat (with reset flag after combat ends)
		- Moved a number of lines of code dealing with child frame anchors of the RQEQuestFrame (scenario, campaign, regular, world quest, achievement) to function outside of previous UpdateRQEQuestFrame() function with call after combat flag/check
		- Added code to prevent PropagateMouseClicks when combat is in process for QuestLogIndexButton button clicks

	RQEDatabase.lua

	RQEFrame.lua
