11.0.2.32
	Buttons.lua
		- Removed unneeded code for preventing some code from running during combat - this appeared to be an error when this is actually taint and most of what I run should be fine to update their own frames in or out of combat

	Core.lua
	EventManager.lua
	QuestingModule.lua
	RQEFrame.lua
	WPUtil.lua
		- Removed unneeded code meant to prevent taint (handling different way for now)

	DebugLog.lua
		- Reverted to a previous version of the DebugLog before I did button checks to determine cause of taint.

	RQEDatabase.lua
		- Added more code and detail to The Rising Deeps (now all three chapters are in the RQEDatabase and able to be accessed by the RQEFrame when super tracked

		- Code clean-up

	Taintless.XML
		- Added to file to reduce issues with such things like Button and Frame Pass-Thru errors that don't effect the overall functionality of the add-on, but are a nuisance unless you have BugSack/BugGrabber addons


11.0.2.31
	Buttons.lua
	Core.lua
		- Fix of error stemming from UpdateFrame function, in Core.lua that some bits weren't allowed to be fired in combat - this this function is now fixed

		- Added InCombatLocked at top of colorize function located here


11.0.2.30

		- Sorted list of flags

	EventManager.lua
		- Fix to propagate error related to RQE:QuestTypes() firing during SUPER_TRACKING_CHANGED event - made so it would re-run function after combat ends
		- Added additional checks after combat ends (PLAYER_REGEN_ENABLED event) to re-run functions if flag passes as true because an earlier attempt, during combat, was made to run said function

	QuestingModule.lua
		- Added Rewards Tooltip for the RQEFrame (SuperTrack quest frame) and the RQEQuestFrame (quest tracker)
		- Fix to propagate error with setting anchor points (RQE.RQEQuestFrameSetChildFramePoints() function) of child frames while in combat (with reset flag after combat ends)
		- Moved a number of lines of code dealing with child frame anchors of the RQEQuestFrame (scenario, campaign, regular, world quest, achievement) to function outside of previous UpdateRQEQuestFrame() function with call after combat flag/check
		- Added code to prevent PropagateMouseClicks when combat is in process for QuestLogIndexButton button clicks

	RQEDatabase.lua

		- Fix implemented following the API change from 11.0 where scenario criteria was no longer available

		- Prevent WaypointButton (stepIndex# buttons) from being updated while in combat as may have been responsible for button passthru error
