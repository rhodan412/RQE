Current Limitations:
--------------------
* There is no countdown timer for Scenario stages, so if you're using this to find out how long between stages for super bloom, or whatever - don't hold your breath as this add-on won't do it. This is something that I would love to put in, but this may require a fairly large re-work.
* Currently special quest items/spells (such as the Area52 Special from the quest: "Mission: The Abyssal Shelf") aren't displayed in the Quest Watch frame or Super-Tracked frame (this is something that I am looking to add)

Save time with RQE! The GIF here shows an example of that with 'The Ghostfish' quest from Wrath of the Lich King. It's an item that once looted, you have to click on it to complete the quest within ONE MINUTE. RQE watches your inventory for many such quest items.![fishing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f635ddb-a233-493f-b86b-0ff0676a87ab)
